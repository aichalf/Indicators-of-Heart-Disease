# Indicators-of-Heart-Disease

This project analyzes **public health data** to explore factors associated with heart disease.  
It was developed as part of my Data Science coursework to demonstrate skills in **data analysis, visualization, and interactive dashboards using Power BI**.

---

## Dataset
- Public dataset on lifestyle and health factors linked to **heart disease risk**.  
- Variables include: Smoking status, BMI, Sleep hours, Age, Sex, and Race/Ethnicity.  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (interactive dashboard design, slicers, DAX measures)  
- **Excel** (data cleaning and preparation)  

---

## Key Features
- **Global indicators**: Heart attack prevalence, smoking rate, average BMI.  
- **Demographics filters**: Race, Sex, Age categories.  
- **Correlations**:  
  - Heart attack risk by sleep hours.  
  - Distribution of BMI across race/ethnicity groups.  
  - Relationship between lifestyle habits (smoking, BMI, sleep) and heart disease.  

---

##  Key Insights
- Overall **heart attack rate**: ~3.9%.  
- **Smoking prevalence**: ~33%.  
- **Average BMI**: 29 (borderline overweight).  
- Higher heart attack rates observed among individuals with **short sleep duration (5â€“7 hours)**.
